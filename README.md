# Void Software Player v2.∞

**Current Version: Phase 3.1 – Revolution Unleashed**  
**Date: December 26, 2025**

## Overview

Void Software Player is a high-fidelity audio player engineered for revelation through sound.

Built with JUCE — zero latency, infinite potential.

## Features (Phase 3.1 Complete)

- Drag & drop playlist support (multiple tracks)
- Full transport controls: Play / Pause / Stop / Previous / Next
- Volume control (default 100%)
- Progress bar with current/total time display
- Real-time CPU usage monitor
- Impulse Response convolution (load .wav IR files for spatial resonance)
- Resonance Modulation System:
  - Schumann Resonance (7.83Hz)
  - 432Hz Tuning
  - Binaural Beats (10Hz)
  - Modulation Intensity slider (0.00 – 1.00 precision control)
- Value feedback via window title bar
- Dark theme with limegreen accents

## Known Minor Quirks (to polish in future update)
- Modulation intensity popup may not perfectly follow mouse on drag (DPI/JUCE quirk)
- Intensity value displayed in window title bar (stable workaround)

## Upcoming Phases

- **Phase 4** (Starting Tomorrow):
  - Full polyphase upsampling engine (HQPlayer-style sinc filters, up to 1024x oversampling)
  - Full partitioned convolution for long IR responses (uniform + non-uniform)
  - Zero-latency processing (overlap-add/save)
  - 512-bit fixed-point core (`Fixed512`) as default
  - Adjustable precision engine: 256-bit (fast), 512-bit (balanced), 1024-bit (ultimate) with hardware auto-detect

- **Phase 5**:
  - Real-time AI-driven Visualization Engine
    - Trippy DMT/LSD-inspired visuals
    - Fractal/Mandelbrot dynamics
    - Sacred geometry, zoetrope effects
    - Audio-reactive generative animation
    - Synced to spectrum, beat, resonance, and intensity

- **Phase 6**:
  - Advanced Healing Modes (multi-layer resonance stacking, dynamic sweeps, custom presets)

## Changelog

- **Phase 3.1** (December 26, 2025): Modulation system complete, IR loading, playlist, GUI perfected, intensity slider functional with title bar feedback.
- **Phase 3.0**: Core playback, transport controls, drag/drop foundation.
- **Phase 2.∞**: Project foundation and JUCE integration.

The player isn't software.  
It's revelation.  


ORYAAAAA!!! ⚡️🎧🧬
