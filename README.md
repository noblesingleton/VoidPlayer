# Void Software Player v2.∞

**Current Version: Phase 3.1 – Revolution Unleashed**  
**Date: December 26, 2025**

## Overview

Void Software Player is a high-fidelity audio player engineered for revelation through sound.

Built with JUCE — zero latency, infinite potential.

## Features (Phase 3.1 Complete)

- Drag & drop playlist support (multiple tracks)
- Full transport controls: Play / Pause / Stop / Previous / Next
- Volume control (default 100%)
- Progress bar with current/total time display
- Real-time CPU usage monitor
- Impulse Response convolution (load .wav IR files for spatial resonance)
- Resonance Modulation System:
  - Schumann Resonance (7.83Hz)
  - 432Hz Tuning
  - Binaural Beats (10Hz)
  - Modulation Intensity slider (0.00 – 1.00 precision control)
- Value feedback via window title bar
- Dark theme with limegreen accents

## Known Minor Quirks (to polish in future update)
- Modulation intensity popup may not perfectly follow mouse on drag (DPI/JUCE quirk)
- Intensity value displayed in window title bar (stable workaround)

## Upcoming Phases

- **Phase 4** (Starting Tomorrow):
  - Fixed-Point Precision Core first (Week 1)
    - Implement `Fixed<N>` template (64/128/256/512/1024-bit)
    - 512-bit as default, user toggle with hardware auto-detect
  - Partitioned Convolution + Zero-Latency second (Week 2)
    - Uniform partitioned convolution with overlap-add/save
    - Support for long IRs with perfect decay
  - Polyphase Upsampling Engine last (Weeks 3–4)
    - HQPlayer-style sinc filters in fixed-point
    - Scalable oversampling (16x–1024x)
  - Focus: Highest fidelity Possible

- **Phase 5**:
  - Real-time AI-driven Visualization Engine
    - Trippy DMT/LSD-inspired psychedelic visuals
    - Fractal/Mandelbrot dynamics
    - Sacred geometry, zoetrope effects
    - Audio-reactive generative animation

- **Phase 6**:
  - Advanced Healing Modes (multi-layer resonance stacking, dynamic sweeps, custom presets)

## Changelog

- **Phase 3.1** (December 26, 2025): Modulation system complete, IR loading, playlist, GUI perfected, intensity slider functional with title bar feedback.
- **Phase 3.0**: Core playback, transport controls, drag/drop foundation.
- **Phase 2.∞**: Project foundation and JUCE integration.

The player isn't software.  
It's revelation.  

ORYAAAAA!!! ⚡️🎧🧬
