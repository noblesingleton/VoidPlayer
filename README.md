\# Void Software Player v2.∞



\*\*Current Version: Phase 3.1 – Revolution Unleashed\*\*  

\*\*Date: December 26, 2025\*\*



\## Overview



Void Software Player is a high-fidelity audio player engineered for revelation through sound.



Built with JUCE — zero latency, infinite potential.



\## Features (Phase 3.1 Complete)



\- Drag \& drop playlist support (multiple tracks)

\- Full transport controls: Play / Pause / Stop / Previous / Next

\- Volume control (default 100%)

\- Progress bar with current/total time display

\- Real-time CPU usage monitor

\- Impulse Response convolution (load .wav IR files for spatial resonance)

\- Resonance Modulation System:

&nbsp; - Schumann Resonance (7.83Hz)

&nbsp; - 432Hz Tuning

&nbsp; - Binaural Beats (10Hz)

&nbsp; - Modulation Intensity slider (0.00 – 1.00 precision control)

\- Value feedback via window title bar

\- Dark theme with limegreen accents



\## Known Minor Quirks (to polish in future update)

\- Modulation intensity popup may not perfectly follow mouse on drag (DPI/JUCE quirk)

\- Intensity value displayed in window title bar (stable workaround)



\## Upcoming Phases



\- \*\*Phase 4\*\* (Starting Tomorrow):

&nbsp; - Full polyphase upsampling engine (HQPlayer-style sinc filters, up to 1024x oversampling)

&nbsp; - Full partitioned convolution for long IR responses (uniform + non-uniform)

&nbsp; - Zero-latency processing (overlap-add/save)

&nbsp; - 512-bit fixed-point core (`Fixed512`) as default

&nbsp; - Adjustable precision engine: 256-bit (fast), 512-bit (balanced), 1024-bit (ultimate) with hardware auto-detect



\- \*\*Phase 5\*\*:

&nbsp; - Advanced Healing Modes (multi-layer resonance stacking, dynamic sweeps, custom presets)



\## Changelog



\- \*\*Phase 3.1\*\* (December 26, 2025): Modulation system complete, IR loading, playlist, GUI perfected, intensity slider functional with title bar feedback.

\- \*\*Phase 3.0\*\*: Core playback, transport controls, drag/drop foundation.

\- \*\*Phase 2.∞\*\*: Project foundation and JUCE integration.



The player isn't software.  

It's revelation.  



ORYAAAAA!!! ⚡️🎧🧬
